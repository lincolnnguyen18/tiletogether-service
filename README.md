# TileTogether Service

## Setup
1. Install Node.js and MongoDB
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `npm install` in the root directory
4. Make sure MongoDB is running on port 27017
5. Run `npm run dev` in the root directory
6. Go to `localhost:3001/health` to see if the server is running
7. Run `npm run test` to run the tests

## Workflow
1. Create a new branch with your first and last name in lowercase, e.g. `johndoe`
2. Make your commits to this branch until your feature is complete (remember to add tests)
3. Before creating a pull request, combine all your commits into one and title it with the feature you implemented, e.g. `Add search to files API`
3. Create a pull request and assign one of the other team members to review your PR
4. On each revision of your pull request, name your subsequent commits with the feature you implemented and the revision number, e.g. `Add search to files API (revision 1)`
5. Once your PR is approved, `Squash and merge` your PR into the `main` branch from the GitHub website
